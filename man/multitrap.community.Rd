\title{mutlilevel+walktrap communities}
\usage{
multitrap.community(graph, n.cores = parallel::detectCores(logical = F),
  hclust.link = "single", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{graph}

\item{n.cores}{number of cores to use}

\item{hclust.link}{link function to use when clustering multilevel communities (based on collapsed graph connectivity)}

\item{...}{passed to walktrap}
}
\value{
a fakeCommunities object that has methods membership() and as.dendrogram() to mimic regular igraph returns
}
\description{
Constructrs a two-step clustering, first running multilevel.communities, and then walktrap.communities within each
These are combined into an overall hierarchy
