\title{get differential correction for all cell types}
\usage{
getCorrectedDE.allTypes(ens.p2, cellfactor, sample.type.comparison,
  membrane.gene.names, n.cores = 1, correction.method = "global",
  cell.types.fc.exclude = NULL, verbose = FALSE, de.method = "deseq2",
  fc.method = "deseq2", correction.global.weight = 1,
  fc.cellfactor = NULL, cell.factor.map = NULL, counts.add.bg = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ens.p2}{pagoda 2 object ensemble}

\item{cellfactor}{a named factor with cell assignments to groups}

\item{sample.type.comparison}{character vector of length 2 signifying the comparison to perform from the sample.type metadata column}

\item{membrane.gene.names}{a character vector of genes to annotate as membrane genes}

\item{n.cores}{number of cores to use}

\item{correction.method}{character of lenght 1 global or exclcurrent, exclcurrent corrects with a vector that excludes considered cel tyep}

\item{cell.types.fc.exclude}{cell types not to consider in generating the fold changes}

\item{verbose}{verbosity logical}

\item{de.method}{method for differential expression, currently only deseq2 supported}

\item{fc.method}{method for fc generation for the correction, deseq2 or dummy (no correction) currently supported}

\item{correction.global.weight}{global weighting of correction, 0 is no correction, 1 default}

\item{fc.cellfactor}{cell factor to use for obtaining FC correction, if NULL cellfactor is used. If this is specified and the correction method is not exclcurrent, then a map from the levels of cellfactor to fc.cellfactor (many to one) need to be specified to know which clusters to drop when excluding the current}

\item{cell.factor.map}{many to one mapping from cellfactor levels to fc.cellfactor levels}

\item{counts.add.bg}{pseudocount to add to all counts, default NULL will add a method dependent adjustment (edgeR will have a pc, other methods not)}
}
